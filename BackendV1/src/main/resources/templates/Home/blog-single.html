                  <p>I used to be a patient too, so I can see that speaking without a subject seems to be an attribute of most people working in the medical industry! Even in a certain health program on HTV stationed by the other master and doctor in charge of the "picture part", on TV talking about health with relatives and aunts but rarely using the subject, trying to listen but not knowing who is she talking to! With her? With children? With her? Or with you?!</p>

                  <p>Hi hi, I'm from Saigon, a genuine Southerner, specializing in "talking". Knowing a native of "Northern Flag", when I was new, every time I went to find the way, asked for the address of the house, I was once corrected by my father: Why did you ask for directions but it was so empty, there were no uncles, aunts, aunts and uncles? ... what's so slippery. At first, it was very devout, anyway, at that time, they were all going to become doctors and grandparents, but they were still petty. Later, I opened a clinic, recruited some Western staff, these "small" and "loving" nurses also specialized in "talking", fortunately my chief nurse was from the North. Migrants, the people of Quan Ho, "run China with their mouths open" to this South, teach them little by little to know how to greet patients properly. This small thought change helped create satisfaction for patients, so that at some point, a patient came to the clinic and said to me, the clinic looks like a dilapidated facility, but the service is no different. international clinic. A compliment is just a small thing, the important thing is that when we know how to listen to different opinions, it will help medical facilities serve better.

                      <p>Wow, when I came to Canada and started working in the Ottawa Hospital, I had to hold back a lot of days! There are many patients called "dark", just looking at the face is not liked! Some illnesses keep channeling their faces, some are taciturn, they don't say a word even though they greet them, some people keep asking for the same thing dozens of times, some get sick and ask others to serve them, some get sick they talk about it. what they say to the contrary. If you are still in Vietnam, say sorry, I would have yelled! But then see the karma they handle very professionally. I just prepare myself in advance to stay amiable and cheerful in any situation, and use reasonable explanations gently (this is an art that requires mental training). awake so as not to wobble). Think they're sick, they have a dilemma, they're being treated poorly, they don't believe, etc. And see them as challenges to your ability to communicate. Being a difficult patient, taciturn when entering the city, open-mouthed, approachable when leaving, you already have a reward! Keep doing that, you will gradually change your attitude and way of thinking in a positive way.</p>

                    I know you have studied and worked a lot in developed countries with good health services. But by the way reading your post, I would like to reiterate the case that I myself had a gynecological examination in Japan. In the ultrasound room, the transducer is divided into two by a cloth curtain, with two doors. 1 door for doctors and nurses, 1 door for patients (patients). When entering the nursing home, instruct the patient to change clothes and sit in a chair (I don't know if I should call it a chair or a bed). On the other side of the curtain, the bsi adjusts the seat to the correct position for the ultrasound. Of course, bs and bn don't see each other, but they still interact well. Because the doctor at the same time did the ultrasound and explained the disease to the patient in words and images from the ultrasound machine (with a screen for the patient to see).
                    It was actually my first gynecological visit but I didn't feel shy at all. After that, I went to a gynecologist a lot, but to be honest with my doctor, I was very shy. Even the doctor's private clinic in a big hospital</p>
